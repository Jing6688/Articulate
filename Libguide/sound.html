<p><span style="font-size:20px;"></span><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>A</strong></span> referencing style is a standardized method for citing sources and formatting documents in academic writing. It provides guidelines on how to credit the original authors of the ideas, data, and information you use in your work, ensuring proper attribution and helping to avoid plagiarism.</p>

<p>Different referencing styles dictate how to format citations within the text and how to organize the bibliography or reference list at the end of a document. Common referencing styles include:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>APA (American Psychological Association):</strong> Often used in social sciences, it emphasizes the author-date format in in-text citations.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>MLA (Modern Language Association):</strong> Commonly used in the humanities, particularly in literature and language studies, it focuses on the author-page number format.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Chicago/Turabian:</strong> Used across various disciplines, with two main variants&mdash;Author-Date and Notes-Bibliography. The Notes-Bibliography style is particularly popular in history and the arts.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Each style has its own rules for formatting citations, references, footnotes, and endnotes, as well as for structuring the overall document.</p>
